# unmanned_river_cleaning_bot
This project emphasis on cleaning the rivers which are dumped with the plastic waste, with the help of public.

The “Unmanned River Cleaning Bot” is used in that places where there is waste debris in the water body which are to be removed. This machine consists of cleaner mechanism which collects and removes the waste and garbage from water bodies.This work can be implemented using automated bots which results in large dissipation of energy and resources. So our alternative is to build the bots which can be accessed through a web application where the individuals are provided with the real time view of the bot in the river. Now the user is able to see where the garbage is residing and is able to move the dump to the specified location. By this we would be able to clean the rivers with the involvement of public in an interactive way.

Precisely what we are going to do is that, we will livestream the view of the bot(which is placed in the river).
And we will have some predetermined locations to dump all the waste.
This livestream can be viewed in a website and the same website will provide you the controls to control the bot.
The user who logged into our website can view the livestream and if he observes any dump in the visible range then he will move the bot to that area by using the controls.

Once the bot reach the dump area then the user will move the dump to the predetermined locations by following the directions shown on the screen.
The directions are given by using a compass.
This way all the dump will reach to the predetermined locations.
Here the things like controlling the bot and searching for dump are done by the public and this is how we will remove the dump by involving the public.
